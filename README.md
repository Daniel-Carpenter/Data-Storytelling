# Intro

## Principles of Storytelling

1.  **Influence over Creativity**: Focus on influence rather than on
    creativity or design quality.
2.  **Story Precedes Evidence**: Establish the story before presenting
    evidence.
3.  **Project Outline First**: Start with an outline of ideas.

## Developing a Narrative Structure in Design

> **Single Story Focus**: Maintain emphasis on one story throughout the
> message.

## Story Structures

| Stage      | Description                                                                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Setup      | Introduce characters and context, outline goals and the storyâ€™s importance.             |
| Conflict   | Identify and capture the conflict using various sources like data anomalies and briefs. |
| Resolution | Detail the decision and resolution of the story.                                        |

## Effective Methods of Storytelling

| Type               | Description                                                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deductive          | Start with a hypothetical answer, establish a point of view, then observe.      |
| Tree Method        | Begin with a hypothesis, support with reasons, and back with evidence.          |
| **SCQA Framework** | **Structure storytelling using Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer.** |
